1. Create your own Resume data in JSON format ?

var Resume = [
    {
        "name" : "santhosh",
        "age" : "33",
        "isRech" : "true",
        "education" : "B.Tech",
        "salary" : "15000",
        "address" :[
            {
                "streetName" : "kulakkari Street",
                "doorNumber" : "386"
            },
            {
                "streetName" : "murugan Street",
                "doorNumber" : "28"
            },
        ]
},

]

//console.log(Resume[0].name);
console.log(Resume[0].address[1].doorNumber);

2.Window & Document Different ?

The Window and Document Object are two of the Parent Objects that we can access with JavaScript. The document object itself is subordinate to the window object. I thing every this is a DOM Tree Structures.

 The Window was already inbuilt the Chrome -> V8 Engine -> Console -> Window.

The document inbuilt to the Window -> Document.

JavaScript variable everything directly work with window Tree & any html relevant Tag work with Document Tree. Both are working each and every variable and Tag worked by DOM Tree Structure.

Window Include to Address bar, Front and Back key, Reload key everything and document only for body structure only. 


1.The window is at a root/top level at the JavaScript object hierarchy. It  is a global/root object in JavaScript and it is the root object of the Document object model(DOM);

Syntax :

Console -> Window

2.A document is an object inside the window object and we use a document object for manipulation inside the document

Syntax :

Console -> Document 

3.For the given JSON iterate over all for loop(for in) ?
var person = {
    "name" : "person 1",
    "age" : "29",
    "city" :" chennai",
    "year" :"2013"
    
    }
    
    person.leaveday = ["Monday","Tusday","And Friday"];
    
    console.log(Object.keys(person));
    var result = " ";
    Object.keys(person).forEach(function(key){
        result += person[key] + " - ";
    })
    
    console.log(result);
    
    //for(var a in person)
    //{
     //   console.log(a,person[a]);
    //}
    //for(i=0;i<person.leaveday.length;i++)
    //{
    //    console.log(person.leaveday[i]); 
    //}
    //console.log(person);
